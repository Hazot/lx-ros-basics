    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Next we will need to import some packages, these will by `rospy` and then the types of *messages* we will be using later.\n",

    "import rospy\n",
    "from sensor_msgs.msg import Joy\n",
    "from duckietown_msgs.msg import WheelsCmdStamped\n",
    "```\n",

    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    # Initialize the node\n",
    "    node = DTJoystickDemoNode()\n",

    "This code initializes a class of type `DTJoystickDemoNode` (which we have yet to define), and then does some ROS-specific stuff, namely initializes the node with the `rospy.init_node` which registers the node with a unique name, and then finally starts the node running with the `rospy.spin()` function. This will ensure that we get data from topics we subscribe to and that data that we publish actually gets sent (among other things).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to define the class called `DTJoystickDemoNode`. We can start with this code:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class DTJoystickDemoNode():\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the publisher and subscriber\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing we need to do in the `__init__` function is setup the publisher and subscriber. For the subscriber this should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        self.sub_joy = rospy.Subscriber(\n",
    "            \"/agent/joy\", \n",

    "Note: Make sure to get the indentation right\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The publisher should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    def process_joy(self,msg):\n",

    "        cmd_to_publish.vel_left = 0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `header` part of the variable contains some meta information, such as a timestamp. It is good practice to copy this over from the incoming data so that we can calculate things like latency, but don't worry too much about this for now. As we say from the definition of the [WheelsCmdStamped.msg](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-ros-commons/blob/daffy/packages/duckietown_msgs/msg/WheelsCmdStamped.msg) message, we need to set a `vel_right` and a `vel_left` (for each of the two wheels on the robot). We can start by initializing those to zero so that in the case that not of the joystick buttons are active we will not move. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we just need to check which of the buttons was pressed and then set the correct values (either + or - `v`) to the corresponding wheels to make the robot go forward or backwards or turn left or right. Recall from the previous investigation that this information comes in on the `axes` data with the [Joy.msg](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Joy.html). Specifically when we did the earlier test, we noticed that pushing forwards makes the second number in that array become `1.0`, pushing backwards makes the second number in that array become `-1.0`, pushing the right arrow makes the fourth number in the array become `-1.0`, and pushing the left hand arrow makes the fourthe number in the array become `1.0`. Using that information and our understanding of how the robot should move we can define the velocities that we should set on the wheels:\n",
