    "\n",
    "-   [msg](http://wiki.ros.org/msg): msg files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message. They are used to generate source code for messages in different languages. msg files are stored in the msg directory of a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "msgs are just simple text files with a field type and field name per line. The field types you can use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   int8, int16, int32, int64 (plus uint\\*)\n",
    "-   float32, float64\n",
    "-   string\n",
    "-   time, duration\n",
    "-   other msg files\n",
    "-   variable-length array\\[\\] and fixed-length array\\[C\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a special type in ROS: Header, the header contains a timestamp and coordinate frame information that are commonly used in ROS. You will frequently see the first line in a msg file have Header named header.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a msg that uses a Header, a string primitive, and two other msgs :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  Header header\n",
    "  string child_frame_id\n",
    "  geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance pose\n",

    "### Creating a msg\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a new msg in the package that was created in the previous tutorial.  In the **EXPLORER** create a folder named `msg` inside the package `my_package`. Inside the `msg` folder create a file named `Num.msg` with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "int64 num\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The example .msg file above contains only 1 line. You can, of course, create a more complex file by adding multiple elements, one per line, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "string first_name\n",
    "string last_name\n",
    "uint8 age\n",
    "uint32 score\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one more step, though. We need to make sure that the msg files are turned into source code for C++, Python, and other languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open package.xml, and make sure these two lines are in it and [uncommented](http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/misc/comment.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>\n",
    "  <exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that at build time, we need \"message\\_generation\", while at runtime, we only need \"message\\_runtime\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Open CMakeLists.txt inside `./workspace/src/my_package/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the message\\_generation dependency to the find\\_package call which already exists in your CMakeLists.txt so that you can generate messages. You can do this by simply adding message\\_generation to the list of COMPONENTS such that it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Do not just add this to your CMakeLists.txt, modify the existing text to add message_generation before the closing parenthesis\n",
    "find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS\n",
    "   roscpp\n",
    "   rospy\n",
    "   std_msgs\n",
    "   message_generation\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that sometimes your project builds fine even if you did not call find\\_package with all dependencies. This is because catkin combines all your projects into one, so if an earlier project calls find\\_package, yours is configured with the same values. But forgetting the call means your project can easily break when built in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also make sure you export the message runtime dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "catkin_package(\n",

    "```\n",
    "add_message_files(\n",
    "  FILES\n",
    "  Num.msg\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding the `.msg` files manually, we make sure that CMake knows when it has to reconfigure the project after you add other `.msg` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we must ensure the `generate_messages()` function is called by adding these lines:\n",
