The topic that we need to publish messages on to make the robot actually move is `/agent/wheels_driver_node/wheels_cmd`. This message is of type [WheelsCmdStamped.msg](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-ros-commons/blob/daffy/packages/duckietown_msgs/msg/WheelsCmdStamped.msg) (this is a message that we defined and is available to us because it is defined in an upstream Docker image).\n",
